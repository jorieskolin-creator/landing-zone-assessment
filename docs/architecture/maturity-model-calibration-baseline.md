# Resolution-based maturity model calibration baseline

Status: Synthetic baseline implemented. Real-run calibration is pending.

This baseline fixes the expected behavior of
`resolution_based_maturity_formula_v1` with pair registry `1.0.0` and
`gamma = 0.5`. It is executable through `npm run test:maturity-calibration`.

| Scenario | Corroborated | Observed | Resolution | Adjusted |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| No evidence | N/A | N/A | 0.0% | N/A |
| Fully healthy | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| Fully adverse | 0.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% |
| Capability 2/3 and anti-pattern presence 1/3 throughout | 66.7% | 66.7% | 100.0% | 66.7% |
| High capabilities only | N/A | 100.0% | 50.0% | 70.7% |
| Six perfect pairs, all others unknown | 100.0% | 100.0% | 20.0% | 44.7% |
| Five domains perfect, domain F unknown | 100.0% | 100.0% | 83.3% | 91.3% |
| Capabilities full; 15 anti-patterns tested absent and 15 confirmed present | 51.7% | 51.7% | 100.0% | 51.7% |

The final scenario has standalone anti-pattern health of exactly 50%. Pair
maturity is 51.7% because `STRONGLY_RELATED` and `CONTEXTUAL` relationships
retain their registered arithmetic component instead of behaving as direct
inverses.

The sparse and domain-blind scenarios demonstrate why Adjusted Maturity cannot
authorize publication or CRAWL/WALK/RUN by itself. Assessment Sufficiency policy
v2 applies 30% hard floors for criterion evidence density and overall resolution,
with warnings below 60%. Per-domain resolution remains telemetry. A separate
strict `<10%` verified criterion-density rule marks a domain silent and limits
that domain to evidence collection without globally blocking classification.

RunTrace exports aggregate-only active results under `resolution_maturity`. It
excludes criterion records, pair records, quotes, source identifiers, and chunk
identifiers. It includes the Assessment Sufficiency decision and has
`scoring_authority: true`.
